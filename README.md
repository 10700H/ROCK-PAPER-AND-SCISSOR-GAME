# ROCK-PAPER-AND-SCISSOR-GAME
This a simple rock paper scissors game implemented in c++

I created this to test some simple features of C++ and the idea of the game was given to me by a friend.
So try running the program and enjoy the game!

there are some things that i did not write in the code. things like choices can accept more numbers than 1,2 and 3.

Any new ideas will be appreciated and contact me to fix problems mentioned above.
